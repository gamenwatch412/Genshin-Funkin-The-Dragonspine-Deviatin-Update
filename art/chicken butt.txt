Hello!
If you're reading this, thank you for picking up our mod.
This update took us a year's worth of time to complete so we hope you enjoy it.

An important notice for those recording and showcasing this mod:
The first three weeks contain copyrighted songs, so if you want to avoid those, we would recommend just playing
Dragonspine Deviatin' along with the bonus tracks for a full showcase experience. Feel free to play the
first three weeks in your own time :)

And now, a personal message from each of the dev team, please support us!:

- Hey yo! Thanks for taking the time to play the mod! I was in charge of pretty much everything code, charting, and
animating related. I also made the songs for Dragonspine Deviatin'. I'm sorry if they sound like trash, this
was my first time composing music so I promise to get better with more experience. Otherwise, hope you have a
great day!

- Hi everyone! Thanks for trying out this FNF mod made by me and my friends.
If you have any suggestions on what we could do to improve this mod, we'd
be glad to receive some feedback! Hope you all enjoy your day.

Thank you for taking the time to read this! Until then, stay safe and enjoy the mod!
