Hello!
If you're reading this, thank you for picking up our mod.

An important notice for those recording and showcasing this mod:
The following weeks contain copyrighted songs:

- Liyue Funkin'
- Inazuma Rockin'
- Mondstadt Balladin'
- Sumeru Serenadin' + If You Suddenly Think of Me bonus song

So if you want to avoid those, we would recommend just playing
Dragonspine Deviatin' along with the bonus tracks for a full showcase experience. Feel free to play the
copyrighted weeks in your own time :)

And now, a personal message from each of the dev team, please support us!:

- Hey yo! Thanks for taking the time to play the mod! I was in charge of pretty much everything code, charting, and
animating related. I also made the songs for Dragonspine Deviatin'. I'm sorry if they sound like trash, this
was my first time composing music so I promise to get better with more experience. Otherwise, hope you have a
great day!

be glad to receive some feedback! Hope you all enjoy your day.
